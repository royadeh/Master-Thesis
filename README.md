# ConvNeXt
ConvNext is a CNN-based network that is designed by the principles of transformers \parencite{liu2022convnet}. This network was designed based on standard ResNet to resemble the design of a vision transformer and apply 1) macro design, 2) ResNeXt, 3) inverted bottleneck, 4) large kernel size, and 5) various layer-wise micro designs.
